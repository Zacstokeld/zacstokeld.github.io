					<h1>A little bit about me</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I was born in Melbourne and have never lived anywhere else in my life. My interest throughout high school were Theatre and the humanities, and I carried that over to my first tertiary education course of a bachelor of arts, with a focus on politics and history. However, after 2 years, I dropped out of the course as it was no longer something I was as passionate about. Which led me to travel in 2019, where I took a 7-month solo tour through China, Russia (pretty good timing on those ones) and Europe. I arrived back in Melbourne at the start of 2020 (again, pretty good timing), and spent the next two years exploring my interests to find my next passion, and that’s when I arrived on programming.</p>

					<h1>My interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p class="ex1">My main interest in IT is that it allows us to interact with the modern world. So many faucets of life either been engulfed by computers (communication, online shopping, transportation, education), and knowing how they function, and how the user interfaces with them, is a necessary skill today. It was my interest in sports analytics that lead me to IT, with the potential of using numbers to quantify a performance, at more than a surface level, drew me in. the further I delved into this subject, the more I saw computers playing a role in processing large amounts of data and making it manageable for statisticians to create new metrics. It led me to start dabbling in coding and trying to teach a machine to do something a human could never do. I find programming in python to be especially fun, as you can tinker, adjust and learn while trying to achieve your result, like some kind of virtual puzzle.</p>

                                        <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56325414?type=standout#sol=5764f33a2914e262d33d9afefa43f9b8535d636b">Click Here for link</a>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p class="ex1">The Primary goal of this position is to use coding and modelling to assist in data analysis for clients. What interests me about this role is both its role in statistics and data modelling, and its focus on problem solving. As I said in my Background, my interest in number crunching stems from my love of sports statistics, and I am excited by the thought of expanding that into the field of business. The role also appeals to my focus on problem solving, and project minded work ethic, as having a single larger goal to achieve tends to get better results out of myself.</p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p class="ex1">I have a beginner’s understanding of Python and not much else in the way of technical skill or experience in any role.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p class="ex1">The main technical skill required for the role is knowing Python coding language, as it is stated as the ‘preferred’ language. However, adeptness at C, C++ and C# is also required. You are also required to have a focus on unit-testing, bug tracking, source control, build systems and agile methodologies. </p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p class="ex1">I am currently enrolled in introduction to programming, which is python language course. I intend on continuing to have programming as my main focus throughout my studies in order to not only increase my level of knowledge in Python, but also to introduce myself to various other languages used frequently such as Java and C#. This study will also help my ability to unit test and bug track. In terms of familiarising myself with agile methodologies and their application, once I have built a skill base, trying to get and internship or a junior software developer role will greatly improve the more abstract skills I am currently lacking.</p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<img src="mediator.png" width="30%" height="22.5% alt="Mediator" />	
              				<h3>Learning styles</h3>
					<img src="learning styles.png" width="30%" height="22.5% alt="learning styles" />
					<h3>Big 5 personality</h3>
				        <img src="big 5.png" width="30%" height="22.5% alt="big 5" />
					<h3>Interpretation</h3>
					<p class="ex1">The Strength and weaknesses of my Myers-Briggs personality type largely capture my own self-assessment of my own characteristics and faults, and are reflective of many issues I tend to face. However, the descriptions focusing on creativity and originality I take with a grain of salt, as I consider myself far more interested in following a structure and process when trying to achieve a goal. The open-mindedness and adaptability are two associated traits of the mediator that I do consider my strengths. As a Visual and kinesthetics learner, I struggle to maintain information that is spoken out loud, and have trouble understanding things without seeing or doing them. I am far more comfortable being given a visual list of objectives or task that can be learnt as I am doing it. The Big-5 personality test indicates similar results as the Myers-Briggs, as agreeableness and openness to new experiences are two major factors. It also indicates a similar lack of focused discipline

I think that these results will make me have a larger focus on working as a complimentary piece in a team setting. I should work well with other teammates and help make interactions between other members run smoothly. In addition to this, I may have to make a special effort to increase my individual discipline and work ethic in order to more not bog the team or the project down. I should take a larger role in being a participant in group discussions rather than a passive listener, as I will get far more out of it that way

When making a team, my flexibility and open-mindedness lend itself to various different working situations and the unique personalities that make them up. Primarily, I will get the most production out of myself if grouped with strong-minded and driven co-workers, and can help grease the wheels of interactions between those, should it be necessary. This will also be helpful in motivating me as I can feed off of their passion, and use it to drive myself harder.

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p class="ex1">I intend to create a mobile App that allows you to view, sort and compare AFL & AFLW statistics from through out history. The app will pull the statistics from a database and will allow you to easily query statistics and pull and sort them as you require. This will be achieved through the use of Python, the SQLite module and Pandas which will allow for self-containment, zero-configuration and serverless application.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p class="ex1">The AFL as an organisation has long been decades behind its international counterparts in regards to the way it delivers its content. From being forced to listen to Brian Taylor every Friday to the disaster that is the official AFL mobile app, it is extremely challenging for consumers to access the information they want. There is a need for a user-friendly, smarter application especially amongst the large amounts of sports gambling, and the thousands of fantasy football coaches who want quick and easy access to whatever stats with whatever parameters they want.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p class="ex1">The main feature of this application would be a search function which would allow users to input filters such as player age, team, statistical range (search for players who avg. < 25 disposals per game and >10 marks per game) or position. This search function will work for totals or per game averages, as well as player and team statistics from either a single season, career, or span of seasons you choose. The information will be displayed in an interactive table where you can tap on a column header that displays a statistic once and it will then sort the searched players or teams by that statistic from highest to lowest, tapping on it a second time will then sort by that statistic from lowest to highest, and a third tap will revert back to its original ordering. Furthermore, tapping on a player’s name will then take you to their individual player pages, which displays all that players recorded stats. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p class="ex1">LA Python Shell and a code editor, such as Atom, would be needed in order to write the code. BeeWare is an open-source mobile app creation framework that allows you to write in Python and release the application on multiple platforms and OS’s. Its tools allow you to run python and package projects so your app can work on different devices. It also has a relatively low skill-curve, making it a feasible option for someone without much of a skill base. Specifically, ill be using the BeeWare Briefcase tool, which converts your Python code into a standalone application.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<li>Learning more complex coding with Python, as well as using modules such as SQLite, and dataframes like Pandas. </li>
					<li>Understanding, creating and manipulating a database with queries, and how to simplify the interaction for users</li>
					<li>Using BeeWare and its various tools, such as Briefcase, Toga and Cricket, in order to convert my code, manipulate native widgets and bug test the GUI</li>
					
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p class="ex1">If this project is successful, it will help improve fans interactions to the game in a more positive way, as it will provide a more comprehensive and easier to use service than what is currently available. </p>
